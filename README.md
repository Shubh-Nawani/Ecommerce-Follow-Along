Ecommerce-Follow-Along
-------------------------

## Project Description
 In this project, you'll create a scalable e-commerce application based on the MERN stack. There you'll learn basics of full-stack development and perform user authentication, product management, and order handling.

-------------------------------

## Milestone 1: Project Overview

### Learning Objectives
 Understand the general structure of a MERN project.
 Create a new project with success.
 Know what an e-commerce application is.
- Project repository should be ready by the next milestone.

### Primary Topics Discussed
1. **Introduction to the MERN Stack:**
   A JavaScript-based technology stack for the development of web applications as full-stack.
   It enables development of both front-end and back-end using one process using JavaScript only.

2. **REST API Structure and Endpoints:
-An architectural style in designing web services.
Some of the example functionalities:
User Authentication: register and login to the user
Product Management: create, update, retrieve information to be presented about the products
Order Management: handle the orders placed by the customers
API endpoints will have to speak to the database. Access to the database acquire data to present as JSON

3.Â Database Schema Design
Â MongoDB Data modeling
Â It expresses the kind of data and how it is represented that exists in.
Â 
4.Â Authentication in Web Applications :
It verifies the user's identity for safe access.
This is required to allow purchases but also to protect the sensitive users' information.
Â 
### Live Demo
In this lecture, we gave a live demo of the e-commerce application in its fully working version, in the following points:
Functionality
User interface
Integration with the backend
- Install all the tools and dependencies to be used in the development environment.
Understand how a server communicates to its client with the help of an API.
Create a basic Node.js server using Express.

Milestone 3: Project Setup for Backend ðŸš€

In this milestone, we focused on setting up the backend to support the growing needs of our e-commerce application. This involved structuring backend code, connecting to MongoDB, and implementing basic error handling.

Key Achievements

Backend Folder Structure:

Organized the backend code into dedicated folders:

routes/: For defining API routes.

controllers/: To handle request and response logic.

models/: For database schemas and models.

middlewares/: For reusable middleware functions.

utils/: For utility/helper functions.

Server Setup:

Initialized a Node.js server using Express.js.

Configured the server to listen on a designated port.

Database Connection:

Integrated MongoDB for efficient data storage and management.

Verified the connection between the server and MongoDB.

Error Handling:

Added basic error-handling mechanisms to:

Provide clear error messages for debugging.

Ensure the server runs smoothly under various conditions.

Documentation Updates:

Updated the README file to reflect progress in Milestone 3.

Getting Started

To set up the backend on your local machine:

Clone the repository:

git clone <repository-link>
cd Ecommerce-Follow-Along

Install dependencies:

cd backend
npm install

Create a .env file in the backend/ directory with the following variables:

PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=<your-mongodb-connection-string>

Run the server:

npm start

Verify database connection:

Check the console for a success message confirming the MongoDB connection.
