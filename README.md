Ecommerce-Follow-Along
-------------------------

## Project Description
 In this project, you'll create a scalable e-commerce application based on the MERN stack. There you'll learn basics of full-stack development and perform user authentication, product management, and order handling.

-------------------------------

## Milestone 1: Project Overview

### Learning Objectives
 Understand the general structure of a MERN project.
 Create a new project with success.
 Know what an e-commerce application is.
- Project repository should be ready by the next milestone.

### Primary Topics Discussed
1. **Introduction to the MERN Stack:**
   A JavaScript-based technology stack for the development of web applications as full-stack.
   It enables development of both front-end and back-end using one process using JavaScript only.

It verifies the user's identity for safe access.
This is required to allow purchases but also to protect the sensitive users' information.
 
### Live Demo
In this lecture, we gave a live demo of the e-commerce application in its fully working version, in the following points:
Functionality
User interface
Integration with the backend
- Install all the tools and dependencies to be used in the development environment.
Understand how a server communicates to its client with the help of an API.
Create a basic Node.js server using Express.
